# sql-challenge

# This project by Andrew Belfiglio is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualization bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

# This repository contains the sql challenge. Six csv files from a fictional company were provided in normalized form. Together, the files provide information about the company and its employees, such as departments, job titles, salaries, etc. All six csv files can be found in the data subfolder, within the EmployeeSQL folder.

# In the EmployeeSQL folder... The ERD.png file shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the provided company data. The diagram.txt file contains the code to recreate the ERD using QuickDBD at https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/. The schema.sql file was written to produce the tables necessary to import the csv data. The query.sql file runs commands to fetch the desired data, which is described in the comments of the code. 

# This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
